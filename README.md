Single cell RNA-seq shows cellular heterogeneity and lineage expansion in a mouse model of SHH-driven medulloblastoma support resistance to SHH inhibitor therapy 

The complete analysis workflow used in this manuscript has been made available as an R notebook.
Following this notebook will allow for complete reproduction of the figures and data.

We have published an app in support of the data.
The app allows for simple viewing of the single-cell data with an R Shiny graphical user interface.
Available at: http://gershon-lab.med.unc.edu/single-cell/
The code used to produce the app and the code used to prepare and format the data files are shared here as well.
